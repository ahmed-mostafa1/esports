-  edit modal: make modal load current data (arabic / english / image / video)



 in Gallery skeleton page we will have another way to edit each card. 
 the admin must have the ability to add / delete / modify each of them  
 and show dynamically in new page each card shows first 40 words of article.description
 also each news card in site/news page must have a button 'read more' when visitor click 
 redirect to a new page with same design of site/gallery.blade.php page but only show clicked
 card content and the card will cover full content width. content will be video with text under the video
 suggest me the bset way to do it


lets improve user experience
(site/tournament-reg.blade.php) make it 2 column page.
the left column shows tournament image 
the right column shows tournament text data and registration buttons
review my feature and give inhancements before planning deployment


in some cases i need to replace images with videos. 
how can we make it accepted from dashboard ?


i want to change ui of popular tournaments section in site/home.blade.php
make it dynamic slider with control buttons just like testimonials section.
slider will show tournament image and tournament text name under the image



check all text in the website and make sure it has translation (ar/en)

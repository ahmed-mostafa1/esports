-  edit modal: make modal load current data (arabic / english / image / video)
-in dashboard when i tried to uplaod a new image i got this error
Server error: SplFileInfo::getSize(): stat failed for /tmp/php06e0ncf0iabccgFmApX


 in news skeleton page we will have another way to edit each card. 
 the admin must have the ability to add / delete / modify each of them  
 and show dynamically in new page each card shows first 40 words of article.description
 also each news card in site/news page must have a button 'read more' when visitor click 
 redirect to a new page with same design of site/news.blade.php page but only show clicked
 card full text content and the card will cover full content width
 suggest me the bset way


lets improve user experience
create a new page (site/tournament-reg.blade.php) that will be used to view a single tournament data and allow users to register
site/tournament-reg.blade.php will take same style of (site/tours-reg.blade.php) but show only one card with data about 
selected tournament and registeration buttons (single / team).
when user click tournament card in homepage or tournaments page 
    -> redirect the user to tournament-reg page with clicked tournament data 
    then user cycle continue as planned before.
review my feature and give inhancements before planning deployment

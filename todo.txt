-  edit modal: make modal load current data (arabic / english / image / video)
-in dashboard when i tried to uplaod a new image i got this error
Server error: SplFileInfo::getSize(): stat failed for /tmp/php06e0ncf0iabccgFmApX


 in news skeleton page we will have another way to edit each card. 
 the admin must have the ability to add / delete / modify each of them  
 and show dynamically in new page each card shows first 40 words of article.description
 also each news card in site/news page must have a button 'read more' when visitor click 
 redirect to a new page with same design of site/news.blade.php page but only show clicked
 card full text content and the card will cover full content width
 suggest me the bset way

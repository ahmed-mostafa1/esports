-  edit modal: make modal load current data (arabic / english / image / video)
-in dashboard when i tried to uplaod a new image i got this error
Server error: SplFileInfo::getSize(): stat failed for /tmp/php06e0ncf0iabccgFmApX


 in Gallery skeleton page we will have another way to edit each card. 
 the admin must have the ability to add / delete / modify each of them  
 and show dynamically in new page each card shows first 40 words of article.description
 also each news card in site/news page must have a button 'read more' when visitor click 
 redirect to a new page with same design of site/gallery.blade.php page but only show clicked
 card content and the card will cover full content width. content will be video with text under the video
 suggest me the bset way to do it


lets improve user experience
(site/tournament-reg.blade.php) make it 2 column page.
the left column shows tournament image 
the right column shows tournament text data and registration buttons
review my feature and give inhancements before planning deployment
